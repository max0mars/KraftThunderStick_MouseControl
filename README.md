# KraftThunderStick_MouseControl

Uses an arduino Nano to read signals from the Kraft Thunderstick and send it through USB COM port. The Python script reads the incoming data and translates it into mouse movement and left click.
Right Clicking the mouse will end the python script incase the control goes awry
